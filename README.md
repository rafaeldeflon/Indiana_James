# Indiana James

This is a project of simple configuration of the Gemini API using python. 

The ideia was to set the bot - Indiana James - to teach history, bringing the informantion in topics, sorted by the date of the events.

The 'chat' file is the main configuration, while the 'test' is the code used for debugging.
